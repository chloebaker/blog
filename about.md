I am a senior at Hendrix College majoring in Math and Computer Science. Right now, I'm working on my senior capstone project developing a short online course to teach people without much experience in Math and Computer Science about cryptocurrencies (focusing on blockchain and hashing.) I also recently began working with a group to develop a contact tracing website for Dr. Kim Maslin, Professor of Politics at Hendrix College.

In my free time, I enjoy watching bad TLC shows, sleeping, and spending time with my fianc√©, Josh Starks. My favorite color is pink, and my favorite food is the house fried rice at [Jade China][jade-china].
