Pink is my favorite color. My favorite shades of pink are flamingo pink and pastel pink. My least favorite shade of pink is Barbie pink. I am very particular about shades of colors, not just pink. I really love the combination of cherry pink and candy apple red, especially if there are some white elements to offset those colors. I really want to dye my hair pink, but bleach hurts.
