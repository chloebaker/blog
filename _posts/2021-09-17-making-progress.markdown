Today, I was able to make some decent progress on styling this blog. What I had to do wasn't all that difficult, but I did make one fatal flaw when I opened up header HTML file in the includes directory of the Jekyll minima theme in the notes app on my laptop. For some reason, all I saw was the Liquid code, so for awhile, that's all I thought there was. In trying to figure out what was going wrong and how to add a link to the header with Liquid, I learned a lot about [Liquid][liquid] and the filters and tags used. Eventually, I went to look at the file on [github][github-file] and realized there was a lot of HTML code that I wasn't seeing. When I tried opening the download of the file my computer already had on Atom, I saw all the code I needed and was able to easily finish what I needed to do with HTML code.

Despite all the hours of struggling with incomplete code, I did have a lot of fun working on this today. My favorite part was adding the "The Color Pink" page. In the future, I'd like to edit the colors (probably add a lot of pink) and fonts of this blog to make it more personalized.

Anyway, I hope these images make you feel better:
