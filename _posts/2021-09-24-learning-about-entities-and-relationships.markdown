This week in Databases and Web Systems, we spent a lot of time learning about entities and relationships, how to make entity-relationship diagrams, and working with SQL to build databases using those diagrams. Our lab this week required we put the skills we developed to use, making an entity-relationship diagram and SQL schema based off of a description for a grocery store website. This is the work I did:

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/9EGEvyy"  ><a href="//imgur.com/a/9EGEvyy">csci340lab5diagram</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/FIsfCQ7"  ><a href="//imgur.com/a/FIsfCQ7">csci340lab5schema</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To complete these, I needed to make a few assumptions like multiple customers can have the same phone number, customers can make more than one order for the same time and date, and customers can choose multiple substitutions for an item in their order from items listed on the website. Once I had finished making the diagram, the SQL schema wasn't all that difficult to figure out. The relationship between them is really close, especially with Vertabelo's drawing interface. I think I did a good job of figuring out the different elements I needed to include and how they should be structured. The mention of the owner in the description threw me off at first, but Dr. Goadrich was able to point me in the right direction in regard to that. It really felt like the bulk of the work was getting the lines to look right in the entity-relationship diagram.
