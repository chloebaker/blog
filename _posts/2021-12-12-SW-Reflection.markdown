The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world as we know it. Effective contact tracing has the potential to minize the spread of COVID and get the pandemic under control so that someday, we might be able to live again like we used to. Dr. Maslin's idea for a contact tracing website for use by the Hendrix community is a great way to implement effective contact tracing by providing an efficient method for figuring out who was exposed to a positive case of COVID based on information collected by the website and notifying those individuals. Although this project focuses on the Hendrix community, other communities could similarly benefit from implementing their own contact tracing websites.

Through working on this project, I came to realize the effectiveness of contact tracing really depends on the individuals involved honestly reporting the necessary information. Even if the website works flawlessly with the information available, the results won't be accurate unless the information provided is correct. Additionally, even if everyone reports honestly, if they don't quarntine once they're been notified that they were potentially exposed to COVID, then they could still spread COVID. In general, getting COVID under control requires the participation of the members of the community.

I have a lot of very strong held beliefs on public issues, including the COVID pandemic before I even started working on this project. Working on this project showed me how I can use my computer science skills to change the world for the better.
