My experience setting up this blog had a pretty rough start. The last time I had to do anything in the terminal, so it took me awhile to get back into handling errors (and there were many!) Luckily, I had some saving graces throughout the process:
* [Dr. Goadrich][dr-goadrich]
* [Google][google]
* [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow]

I feel a lot more confident with using the terminal having refreshed myself through this experience. I still don't totally understand what all of the commands do, but I think I have a good grasp of the basics and how to figure out what you need to do to fix errors. So far, Jekyll seems pretty easy to use too, especially considering the difficulties I encountered when programming my first two webpages. I'm really excited to find out what else Jekyll can do in the future!
